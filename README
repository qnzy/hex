Small hexdump utility that can also do reverse hexdumps.

hex [-r] [-h] [inputFile] [-o outputFile]
    -h         : this help
    -r         : reverse hexdump (read hex and write binary)
    inputFile  : file to read,  default is stdin
    outputFile : file to write, default is stdout

In reverse mode, input should be a sequence of hexadecimal numbers
smaller than 256. A semicolon starts a comment to the end of the
line.

(I've written this for fun and it works well enough. For a more 
mature/powerful tool you might want to look at xxd).
